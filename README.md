> Automatic plant watering system using a relay and raspberry pi 3

In its current state, the script checks the sensor if moisture is detected and lets the pump shoot water onto the plant until water is detected. In upcoming updates i hope to make the software more aware of how much water the plant is being given to avoid drowning the plant. I also have plans to implement a humidity sensor and link a humidifier that would be used for any plant needing moisture regulation. I also hope to implement a HTML interface so that i can access the system wherever i am and make it easier for others to monitor it aswell. A cool idea would be to add a web monitoring system with a webcam that i have spare but that might come in the late future for this project
